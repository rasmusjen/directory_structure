# Directory Structure Project

This project provides a Python-based tool to generate an overview of folder contents and the file/directory structure. It can be used to recursively list files and directories in a human-readable format, making it easy to visualize the layout of a directory.

## Features

- Recursively lists all files and subdirectories within a given directory.
- Outputs a human-readable directory tree.
- Configuration of input paths via an external `settings.ini` file.
- Customizable path and logging settings.
